## Output Mapping to STIX 2.1
Explain how the output can be mapped to schema fields in STIX 2.1

    Shodan output can be mapped to STIX 2.1 using a mapping of the relevant fields in the Shodan output to the corresponding STIX 2.1 fields. Here are some examples of how Shodan output can be mapped to STIX 2.1:

        1. IP address: The "ip_str" field in Shodan output can be mapped to the "ipv4-addr.value" field in STIX 2.1.

        2. Device type: The "product" or "os" fields in Shodan output can be mapped to the "device.type" field in STIX 2.1.

        3. Open ports: The "ports" field in Shodan output can be mapped to the "network-traffic.src_port" or "network-traffic.dst_port" fields in STIX 2.1, depending on whether the port is a source or destination port.

        4. Operating system: The "os" field in Shodan output can be mapped to the "operating-system.name" field in STIX 2.1.

        5. Geolocation: The "latitude" and "longitude" fields in Shodan output can be mapped to the "location.latitude" and "location.longitude" fields in STIX 2.1, respectively.

    Other fields in Shodan output, such as banners, metadata, and organization information, can also be mapped to relevant STIX 2.1 fields depending on the context and use case.

    Mapping Shodan output to STIX 2.1 can provide a standardized and structured representation of the information gathered by Shodan, which can be useful for sharing and exchanging threat intelligence.
